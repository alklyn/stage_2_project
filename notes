simple:

A string is a sequence of one or more __1__ surrounded by quotes. If you start
a string with a single quote you have to end it with a __2__ quote. If you start 
a string with a __3__ quote you have to end it in a double quote. Using the 
plus operator we can __4__ two or more strings together. The index of the first
character of a string is __5__.

medium:

Strings are __1__table while lists are __2__table. Immutable objects cannot be
__2__ed once they are created. As a result string objects do not support item 
__3__. It is called __4__ when there are two names that refer to the same object
and this only occurs in __5__table objects.

hard:

An __1__ variable is a variable that is unique to each instance of a class and
it is defined __2__ a method of the class. __3__ variables are for attributes 
shared by all instances of the class. __4__ is the transfer of characteristics
of a class to other classes that are derived from it. When a method defined in
a derived class has the same name as a method in it's base class it __5__ the 
method in the base class.
