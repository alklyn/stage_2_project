simple:

A string is a sequence of one or more __1__ surrounded by quotes. If you start a string with a 
single quote you have to end it with __2__ quote. If you start a string with a __3__ quote you 
have to end it in a double quote. Using the plus operator we can __4__ two or more strings together.

medium:

string.find(s, sub[, start[, end]])
The find method returns the __1__ __2__ in string s where the substring sub is 
found in s. Find returns __3__ if sub is not found in the slice s[start:end]. 
Both start and end are __4__.


hard:

An __1__ variable is a variable data unique to each instance of a class and it
is defined __2__ a method. __3__ variables are for attributes shared by all 
instances of the class. __4__ is the transfer of characteristics of a class to
other classes that are derived from it. When a method defined in a derived 
class has the same name as a metod in it's base class it __5__ the method
in the base class.
